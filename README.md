# Snake
A JavaScript Snake Game

While working through the [snake game section of HTDP](https://htdp.org/2021-5-4/Book/part_two.html#%28part._sec~3aworms%29) I decided to give the exercises (making a snake game essentially) a go in JavaScript.

What is left to be improved is that the food may spawn over the snake currently, and some tests only pass when the constants are set to certain values.

To play this snake game, put index.html, style.css, and app.js into a folder and open index.html in a browser.
